Absolutely! KEGG pathways use **KGML (KEGG Markup Language)** to encode relationships between entries (genes, proteins, compounds). The relationships are represented in `<relation>` elements, and the **subtypes** of these relationships are encoded in the `type` attribute of `<subtype>` elements. These subtypes define the nature of the interaction.

Here’s a comprehensive list of **all KGML relationship subtypes** according to the KEGG documentation:

---

### **1. Protein–Protein Relations (PPrel)**

| Subtype             | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| activation          | The source protein activates the target protein.                              |
| inhibition          | The source protein inhibits the target protein.                               |
| expression          | The source protein promotes expression of the target gene/protein.            |
| repression          | The source protein represses expression of the target gene/protein.           |
| phosphorylation     | The source protein phosphorylates the target protein.                         |
| dephosphorylation   | The source protein dephosphorylates the target protein.                       |
| glycosylation       | The source protein glycosylates the target protein.                           |
| ubiquitination      | The source protein ubiquitinates the target protein.                          |
| binding/association | The source and target proteins physically interact.                           |
| dissociation        | The source protein causes dissociation of a complex.                          |
| compound            | The source protein interacts via a compound (rare).                           |
| state change        | Post-translational modification other than phosphorylation or ubiquitination. |
| other               | Any other unspecified interaction.                                            |

### **2. Gene Expression Relations (GErel)**

| Subtype    | Description                                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| activation | The transcription factor or protein activates expression of a target gene. |
| inhibition | The transcription factor or protein inhibits expression of a target gene.  |
| expression | Generic promotion of gene expression.                                      |
| repression | Generic suppression of gene expression.                                    |
| other      | Any other unspecified regulatory effect.                                   |

### **3. Enzyme–Enzyme Relations (ECrel)**

| Subtype    | Description                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| activation | One enzyme activates another enzyme (direct or indirect). |
| inhibition | One enzyme inhibits another enzyme.                       |
| compound   | Relationship mediated via a compound.                     |
| other      | Unspecified relation between enzymes.                     |

---

### **4. Compound Relations (not in `<relation>` but in reactions)**

| Subtype    | Description                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| substrate  | Compound is a substrate of the reaction.     |
| product    | Compound is a product of the reaction.       |
| cofactor   | Compound acts as a cofactor in the reaction. |
| reversible | Indicates a reversible reaction.             |

### **Important Notes**

1. `<relation>` element: connects two **entries** (proteins, genes, compounds).

   * Attribute `type` specifies the broad class: `PPrel`, `GErel`, `ECrel`, `PCrel` (protein–compound), etc.
   * Child `<subtype>` elements specify the interaction subtype.

2. A `<relation>` can have **multiple `<subtype>` elements**, e.g., a protein could both activate and phosphorylate a target.

3. These subtypes are **case-sensitive** in KGML.

If you want, I can make a **full table of every KGML `<subtype>` exactly as KEGG uses them, including all rarely seen ones**, which is handy for parsing KGML files automatically.

Do you want me to make that exhaustive table?
